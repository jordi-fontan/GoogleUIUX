Hello again and welcome to the
first week of the program. I hope that you are just as excited as I am to get started. At the beginning of every week, you can look forward to
a video like this one, from me or one of my colleagues. We'll give you a
brief rundown of what you can expect
to learn that week. This week we'll explore
how this program works. Then, we'll cover the
definition of UX design and why UX design is important
for consumers and businesses. We'll also discuss
the different roles within the field of UX, what makes a user
experience good or poor, the responsibilities of
entry-level UX designers, how UX designers work
with cross-functional teams, differences in UX design jobs depending on company
size and industry, and how to pursue a
career in UX design. As you can tell, we have a lot of learning ahead of
us. Let's get started.

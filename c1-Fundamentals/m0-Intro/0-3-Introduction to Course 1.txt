Welcome to your first course. Anyone interested in UX design
can complete this course, because you don't need any
previous experience in design, and you don't need
a college degree. In this first video,
we'll cover the goals of the course and the history of UX design. UX designers help make technology easier
to understand and more enjoyable to use. So, when did the study of
user experience, or UX, begin? Let's learn some quick history,
to get us up to speed. The phrase "user experience"
was first coined in the 1990s, by cognitive psychologist, Don Norman, as technology use expanded and evolved. Although the term came
about relatively recently, the principles of user experience
actually stretch back thousands of years, all the way to ancient China,
where the practice of Feng Shui began. Practitioners believe that
the arrangement of a physical space, like how furniture is positioned in a room,
could bring someone luck or improve their health and happiness. Today, lots of different industries
still rely on these same basic ideas. In the tech world, user experience
mostly focuses on how people use or interact with products. In this course,
we'll explore the foundations of UX design and why it's so important for
consumers and businesses. We'll learn common terms, tools, and
frameworks that UX designers use. We'll discuss how to plan and
participate in design sprints, a common method for
collaborating on projects. And finally, you'll begin to build
your professional presence online, including starting your portfolio.
To help keep track of what you're learning, you'll take practice quizzes and
complete peer reviews and self reviews. You'll get plenty of chances
to go over the materials and practice. At the end of the week, you'll wrap up
the course with a graded assessment, to show what you know. So, let's start at the beginning and learn
the basics of user experience design.
